Thank you for stopping by on my blog! My name is Paulina, and I am a self-taught software developer with a solid background in Oil&Gas.  I worked in Oil&Gas for around eight years, and I made a career switch to web development in August 2018. I am energetic, curious, and always wanting to try new things.

I'm about all things positivity, love, doing hard things, and lifelong learning. I am committed to getting 1% better every day in every area of my life and becoming the best version of myself. I love learning new things and challenging myself daily. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will see more of in my posts.

### Why I started my blog

Since I make a career shift from Oil&Gas to software development, many of my friends have asked me, "Why don't you start a blog and share your experience?!". This question repeated in conversation with my friends and acquaintances so often that I pulled the trigger and committed to creating a personal blog! On this blog, I will not only want to share with you my journey through the software development world but also will take share with you the process that leads me to achieve my personal goals (self-development, fitness, nutrition).

I hope to inspire other people (especially women) that are interested in switching their career or picking some coding skills. I am SO looking forward to bringing you on my journey and share with you my successes and failures so you can learn from them and apply this knowledge to your life and career.
 Failures so you can learn from them and apply to your life and career.
### What you will see more of in my posts

Software development will be the main topic of my blog. I will mostly focus on full-stack JavaScript development. I share with you my learning on the technologies I am using or currently learning. Those will include (but not exclusive) vanilla JavaScript libraries like React, Redux, Express, etc. I plan to create tutorials and exercises for my readers to help them sharpen their coding skills. Besides of the web development, I am also following Blockchain and developments of Solidity programming language closely. So get ready because you will be seeing much more of the face behind Paulina (me), and a mixture of my other obsessions like personal development, books, biohacking, fitness and whatever I am interested at that time.

Writing has never been a strong suit of mine, and I will tell you, I am no expert on any of this.  I figure it will be a lot of trial and error so please bear with me (disclaimer: I am not native English speaker) and please feel free always to share your advice and communicate with me along the way!

I hope to inspire other people (especially a young woman) who are thinking of a career change. I know how big of a challenge this may seem, so I want to let you know that you are not alone and that success is possible. Never forget the wise words of Lao Tzu:

I hope to motivate you not only to become a developer but also  bester version of yourself. We are on this journey together.
