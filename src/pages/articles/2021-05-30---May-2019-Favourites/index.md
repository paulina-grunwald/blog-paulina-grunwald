It’s my first ever favourites. In this blog post I will share with you a product, book, podcast episode or anything I found interesting over the course of the month.

### Podcast episode

This month my favourite podcast episode was conversation between Peter Attia and Joko Willing on podcast called ["The Dive"](https://peterattiamd.com/jockowillink1/). For those that don't know Peter Attia is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. He is known for his medical practice that focuses on the science of longevity. I have been following Peter for quite since I am very much interested in optimizing my health and performance. Podcast is very technical but delivers incredible value. If you are interested in biohacking, you will find it helpful.

In last episode of "The Dive" Peter interviewed Jocko Willing. Jocko is retired Navy SEAL, podcaster and author of the several book including "Extreme Ownership" which i higly recommand. Jocko shared his most important lessons he learned from his time in military. He explained why humility is important trait of leaders and how to implement systems in your life.

### Book of the Month

This month I read a book og Austin Kleon ["Show your work"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work). Book's aim is to help you unlock your creativity by getting inspired by other members of the community. It is filled with illustrations, quotes, stories and examples on how you create something and share it with the world. Austin claims that "...creativity is always, in some sense, a collaboration, the result of a mind connected to other minds." He states that if we want to start sharing our work we should learn something new and then to show the process to the others so they can also learn from us. He encourages readers to work everyday on something diligently
This book ultimately motivated me to start this blog and share my thoughts and learning with other people.

### Website of the Month

Like all programmers I spend most of my day in text editor crafting my code. For quite some time I have been using Visual Studio code.

Recently, I have discovered the webside [vscodecandothat](https://vscodecandothat.com/) which gives you pratical tips&tricks about Visual Studio Code that nobody ever bothered to tell you. If you want to increase your producitivity using VSCode tutorials on the websire will be extremly helpful.

### Programing course of the Month

I have been looking for a courses and tutorials about debugging and found one very good one on FrontMasters [Debugging and Fixing Common JavaScript Errors](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/debugging-javascript/). Todd Gardner (Co-founder of TrackJS), walks through common JavaScript bugs and how to isolate and fix the source of the problems
